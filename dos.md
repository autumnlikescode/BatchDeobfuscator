**Decoding Python Obfuscation (Pyfuscate): A Step-by-Step Guide**

*Unraveling the Layers of Obfuscated Python Code*

---

### Introduction

Python, known for its readability and simplicity, can sometimes take on a different face when subjected to obfuscation techniques. This blog post will guide you through the process of decoding a specific type of obfuscated Python code, generated using the Pyfuscate tool. We'll dive into the intricate steps involved in revealing the underlying logic of such code, all while shedding light on the mechanisms of the obfuscation itself.

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with bytecode and Python's `marshal` module
- Knowledge of code disassembly using Python's `dis` module

### Original Code

For reference, here is the original code that was obfuscated:

```python
while True:
    print("flow 1 for 1")
```

### Obfuscated Code

For reference, here is the obfuscated code, the bytes are truncated as they are too large:

```python
# Encoded By Py-Fuscate
# https://github.com/Sl-Sanda-Ru/Py-Fuscate
# Make Sure You're Running The Program With python3.8 Otherwise It May Crash
# To Check Your Python Version Run "python -V" Command
try:
	import marshal,lzma,gzip,bz2,binascii,zlib;exec(marshal.loads(zlib.decompress(b'x\x9c\xb4\x96C\x8c0\x0c\xd0\xa4\xc7\xb6m\xdb\xb6m\xfb\x1d\xdb\xb6m\xdb\xb6m\xdb\xb6m{\xf6\xdb\x7fo\x9b\xecq;\xe9z\x0e\x9dT*\xa9K\x1b\x01\xfc_\x03\xf6\xdf\n\xfc\xb7N\x12\xff\x891\x801\xa05\x80\xd6\xff!\xa0\x16\xe0...rest of compressed bytes]')))
except KeyboardInterrupt:
	exit()
```

### Reconstruct before decoding

First we will reconstruct the python file to set it up, to be ready for decoding.
```python
import marshal,lzma,gzip,bz2,binascii,zlib
ran = marshal.loads(zlib.decompress(b'x\x9c\xb4\x96C\x8c0\x0c\xd0\xa4\xc7\xb6m\xdb\xb6m\xfb\x1d\xdb\xb6m\xdb\xb6m\xdb\xb6m{\xf6\xdb\x7fo\x9b\xecq;\xe9z\x0e\x9dT*\xa9K\x1b\x01\xfc_\x03\xf6\xdf\n\xfc\xb7N\x12\xff\x891\x801\xa05\x80\xd6\xff!\xa0\x16\xe0...rest of compressed bytes]'))
```

### Decoding the Obfuscated Code

Here's how the decoding part of the script works:

1. **Decoding Loop**

    A loop is initiated to decode and execute the code a set number of times, which can be adjusted to match the obfuscator's complexity value. Each iteration aims to unveil one layer of obfuscation, gradually revealing the original code. For example is you put in an iteration of 30 and the complexity was 50, you will have 20 layers that still need to be decoded. An easy way to fix this is set the iteration level very high 100+

    ```python
    for i in range(iterations):
    ```

2. **Disassembling the Bytecode**

    The bytecode of the current `ran` object is disassembled using `dis.Bytecode(ran).dis()`. This disassembly provides a human-readable representation of the bytecode instructions, making it easier to manipulate.

    ```python
    disassembly = dis.Bytecode(ran).dis()
    ```

3. **Extracting New Code**

    The disassembled code is split at 'exec' instructions, and the parts after each 'exec' are joined together. This effectively removes the initial setup code and focuses on the main logic.

    ```python
    new_code = "exec".join(disassembly.split('exec')[1:])
    ```

4. **Extracting Constant Data**

    The constant data is extracted by splitting the new code at 'LOAD_CONST' instructions and processing the relevant parts. The constant data usually contains key information for code execution.

    ```python
    const = new_code.split("LOAD_CONST")[1]
    const = const.split("')\n")[0].split(" (b'")[1]
    data = f"b'{const}'"
    ```

5. **Extracting Function Names**

    The code is further split at 'LOAD_CONST' instructions to extract function names. These function names are used to reconstruct the original code.

    ```python
    functions = new_code.split("LOAD_CONST")[0]
    functions = [f for f in [func.split(")")[0] for func in functions.split("(")] if f]
    ```

6. **Reconstructing and Executing Commands**

    Using the extracted function names and the constant data, a command string is constructed. This command string effectively rebuilds the original code. The constructed command is executed using `eval`, updating the `ran` object for the next iteration.

    ```python
    command = "(".join([f"{functions[i]}.{functions[i+1]}" for i in range(0, len(functions), 2)]) + "("
    command += data
    command += ")" * (len(functions) // 2)
    ran = eval(command)
    ```

7. **Exception Handling**

    Robust exception handling ensures that any errors during the decoding process are caught. This helps diagnose potential challenges and keeps the decoding loop running.

    ```python
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
        print("[!] are we at a new style of code?")
    ```

8. **Final Output**

    After completing the specified number of iterations, the final result of the decoded and executed code is printed. Additionally, the bytecode instructions of the final result are displayed using `dis.dis(ran)`.

    ```python
    print(ran)
    print(dis.dis(ran))
    ```

### Conclusion

Decoding obfuscated Python code can be a challenging yet rewarding endeavor. By understanding the underlying techniques employed in obfuscation and leveraging Python's built-in modules, we can systematically peel away the layers of obfuscation and uncover the true nature of the code. The process serves as an excellent exercise in code analysis, bytecode manipulation, and creative problem-solving.
